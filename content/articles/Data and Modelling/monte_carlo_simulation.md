Tags: python, simulation, mathmatics, monte carlo simulation


## Objective
+ Appling the concept of Monte Carlo simulation to solve or analyse problem in the real world.
+ Improve the programming skills by applying flowchart to visualize the
      code structure.  
+ Practising with the fundamental programming elements, including variables, functions, comprehensive data types (list and arrays), expressions, control structures (if-else, while, for).


## Reading Materials
+ [Monte Carlo Simulation 16.1]({attach}/pdfs/monte_carlo.pdf)
+ [Finding Pi 16.4]({attach}/pdfs/findingpi.pdf)
+ [Gambler's ruin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_ruin)


## Lessions and exercises
+ Repetition: flow chart and pseduocode 
+ Continue with our secretary problem  
    + Simulation
        + Draw the flow diagram of selecting strategy. 
        + Program according to the flowchart.
    + Verification
        + Is 36.79% the correct stop point? 
+ What is Monte Carlo Simulation. We start from tossing coins. 
    + Which problem is "Pascal's problem"(explained in reading materials) about? is that true?
    + How about this [Gambler's fallacy](https://dev.to/josethz00/math-for-devs-gamblers-fallacy-and-monte-carlo-simulation-453a) 
+ Do it yourself
    + Write code for "finding Pi" according to the description in **Reading Materials**
    +(Advanced) Write code to proof the "gambler's ruin" (hint: random walk in a line).
