## Objective
+ Learn to use NumPy for numerical computation, pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for visualization.



## Reading Materials
+ [The secretary problem](https://medium.com/pythoneers/the-secretary-problem-how-to-optimize-your-chances-of-success-c18665184b8f)
+ [Flow Chart](https://programmering.systime.dk/?id=148)


## Lesson Plan
+ Install all the required packages for using numpy, pandas and matplotlib
    + All of the installation instructions below recommand installing Anaconda environement first or using pip install. Give them a try, if it's way too tricky, skip this step and jump to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to start your exercise, you should not waste too much time on it and get frustrated. 
    + It is recommaned using [Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) (or google colab) to run the exercises, as they offers the notebook editing environment and gives a "simplified, lightweight notebook authoring experience".   
    + Install numpy, pandas and matplotlib
        + https://numpy.org/install/
        + https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html
        + https://matplotlib.org/stable/install/index.html
+ Go through the tutorials. The tutorials are not the most exciting part, you are going to get bored. Remember no pain no gain ;).  
    + https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html
    + https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/pyplot.html
    + https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html

## Exercises
    + Read **"Plotting a Simple Line Graph"** from Chapter 15 (page 324) of Python Crash book chapter, finish the exercise 15.1 and 15.2 in **Try it yourself**
    + (For the quick ones) continue to random walk.
