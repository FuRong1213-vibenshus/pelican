## Objective
+ understand Problem Modeling in Computer Science:
    + Use computer program to reasearch a subject/problem, by means of
      modelling or simulating.
+ Improve the programming skills by applying flowchart to visualize the
      code structure.  
+ Practising with the fundamental programming elements, including variables, functions, comprehensive data types (list and arrays), expressions, control structures.
